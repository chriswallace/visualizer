# AI Companion Visualizer Demo

Welcome to the AI Companion Visualizer! This interactive demo showcases dynamic blob animations that respond to different AI states.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Start the visualizer**: The development server should be running at `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Open your browser**: Navigate to the URL above
3. **Experience the magic**: Watch the mesmerizing blob animations!

## 🎮 Interactive Controls

### State Buttons (Top-Left Corner)
Click any of the four state buttons to see the visualizer transform:

- **🔵 Idle**: Calm, gentle floating movements with cool blue/purple colors
- **🟢 Listening**: Energetic green blobs with increased animation speed
- **🟡 Thinking**: Rapid, chaotic movements in warm orange/yellow tones
- **🔴 Speaking**: Rhythmic pink/red animations with expressive movements

### Advanced Controls (Leva Panel)
Click to expand the Leva control panel for fine-tuning:

#### Global Effects
- **Blob Count**: Adjust the number of animated blobs (3-8)

#### Blob Material
- **Distortion Scale**: Control the morphing intensity (0-2)
- **Roughness**: Surface texture (0-1)
- **Metalness**: Metallic appearance (0-1)
- **Emissive Intensity**: Glow effect strength (0-1)

## 🎨 Visual Features

### Dynamic Animations
Each blob features multiple animation layers:
- **Rotation**: Continuous 3D rotation on all axes
- **Floating**: Vertical oscillation with sine wave motion
- **Orbital Movement**: Circular paths around their base position
- **Scale Pulsing**: Rhythmic size changes based on AI state

### Material Effects
- **Distortion Material**: Vertex displacement for organic blob shapes
- **Emissive Properties**: Self-illuminating colors
- **Transparency**: Subtle alpha blending for depth
- **Multiple Lighting**: Ambient and directional lights for atmosphere

### Color Psychology
Each AI state uses carefully chosen color palettes:
- **Idle**: Blues and purples for tranquility
- **Listening**: Greens for attention and focus
- **Thinking**: Oranges and yellows for creativity and energy
- **Speaking**: Pinks and reds for communication and expression

## 🔧 Customization Tips

### Adjusting Performance
- **Lower blob count** for better performance on slower devices
- **Reduce distortion scale** to decrease GPU load
- **Lower emissive intensity** for subtler effects

### Visual Tuning
- **Increase metalness** for more reflective surfaces
- **Adjust roughness** for different surface textures
- **Modify distortion** for more or less organic movement

## 🎯 Use Cases

This visualizer is perfect for:
- **AI Assistant Interfaces**: Visual feedback for voice assistants
- **Meditation Apps**: Calming visual accompaniment
- **Music Visualizers**: Reactive animations to audio
- **Loading Screens**: Engaging wait time experiences
- **Ambient Displays**: Beautiful background animations

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights

- **React Three Fiber**: Modern React renderer for Three.js
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient rendering with 60fps target
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **WebGL Compatible**: Works on modern browsers with hardware acceleration
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety and better development experience

## 🎪 Try This!

1. **State Cycling**: Rapidly switch between states to see smooth transitions
2. **Blob Count Experiment**: Try maximum blobs (8) for a chaotic experience
3. **Material Play**: Max out distortion and emissive intensity for alien effects
4. **Minimal Mode**: Set blob count to 3 with low distortion for subtle beauty

## 📱 Mobile Experience

The visualizer works on mobile devices! 
- Touch the state buttons to switch modes
- Pinch to zoom and pan around the scene
- Performance automatically adapts to device capabilities
